When adding a new member to the keyring-maint team there are various
steps which need to be performed.

 * Signed email to DSA (admin@rt.debian.org, remember to add Debian RT
   in the subject). This should include the name + Debian username of
   the new team member and ask for the following:

    * User addition to keyring group (which will allow access to
      kaufmann)
    * Addition to "Keyring Maintainers" LDAP object to enable editing of
      fingerprint objects
    * User account on rt.debian.org with access to the 2 keyring queues
    * Addition to keyring-maint@debian.org email alias
    * Import new member's Debian key into debian-trustedkeys.gpg
    * Potential modification of dsa-misc/scripts/sync-keyring to include
      new member's fingerprint

 * Inform the NM Front Desk team with username, email address +
   fingerprint details so keyring/git_ops.py and keyring/housekeeping.py
   can be updated with the additional details

 * Inform FTP master of the new member + fingerprint so they can be
   added to DM-Admin / AdminFingerprints in dak.conf
